My personal attempt at constructing a cross-platform, performance pathtracer using C/C++ and NVidia's CUDA platform. 
Code written and tested with NVidia Nsight (mac) and Microsoft VS2015 (win).

Code is partly based on the "Raytracing in one weekend" mini-books by Peter Shirley:

- https://www.amazon.com/Ray-Tracing-Weekend-Minibooks-Book-ebook/dp/B01B5AODD8

Another source of inspiration are the amazing explanations on scratchapixel:
