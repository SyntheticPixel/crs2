My personal attempt at constructing a performance pathtracer using C/C++ and Nvidia's CUDA platform. 
Should be fairly cross-platform, tested on mac OSX (10.12.3) and Win 10 64-bit.

Code is largely based on the fantastic tutorials and "Raytracing in one weekend" mini-books by Peter Shirley:

- https://www.amazon.com/Ray-Tracing-Weekend-Minibooks-Book-ebook/dp/B01B5AODD8

Another source of inspiration are the amazing explanations on scratchapixel:

- Nvidia Cuda (version 8 was used in development): https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit
