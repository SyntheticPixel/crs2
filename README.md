My personal attempt to construct a performance pathtracer using C/C++ and Nvidia's CUDA platform
Should be fairly cross-platform, tested on mac OSX (10.12.3) and Win 10 64-bit.

Code is largely based on the fantastic tutorials and "Raytracing in one weekend" books by Peter Shirley:

Another source of inspiration are the amazing explanations on scratchapixel:
